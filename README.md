# storage-sdk
This is the storage driver SDK from the CoprHD project - https://coprhd.github.io/

To get the latest release of CoprHD, the easiest way is to grab an image for testing: 
https://build.coprhd.org/jenkins/userContent/releases/CoprHD-3.5.0.0.317/ 

Or you can build from source using this guide:
https://coprhd.atlassian.net/wiki/display/COP/How+to+Download+and+Build+CoprHD 

You can always find the latest CoprHD source from GitHub:
git clone https://github.com/CoprHD/coprhd-controller.git coprhd

We hope that others can adopt the CoprHD storage SDK for their software-defined storage controllers. To get started using the SDK, check out the Programmer's Guide in this repository.
